## LLVM Version

ykrustc requires a version of LLVM supporting code-gen for DILabels.

At the time of writing, this has not been merged into master. More details can
be found here:
https://reviews.llvm.org/D45045

Until this is merged, use the `master` branch in:
https://github.com/Hsiangkai/llvm.git

ykrustc was developed using version 4d9f26638007efe1c0dd8ccd689bad808df5a772.

Don't forget to update `llvm-config` in your config.toml:

```
[llvm]
...
llvm-config = "/path/to/your/llvm/install/bin/llvm-config"
```

If you don't have a `config.toml`, you can use `config.toml.example` as a base.
